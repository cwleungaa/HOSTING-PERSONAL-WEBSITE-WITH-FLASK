            This section introduces how an AI can be constructed to process human language.

            Context-Free Grammar<br>
            In Context-Free Grammar, the text is abstracted from its meaning to represent the structure of the sentence using formal grammar.<br>
            In python, we can use library nltk to implement this idea(Project: Parser).           
        </p>

            Information Retrieval<br>
            Information retrieval is the task of finding relevant documents in response to a user query. <br>
            We use tf-idf, by considering term frequency and Inverse Document Frequency, to assign a value to each word.<br> 
            This method can output a list of words per document that are likely to span the main topics that define the document(Project: Questions).            
        </p>

            1.	Parser<br>
            <img class = "game" src="/static/parser.png" alt="Parser" title="Parser">
            Write an AI to parse sentences and extract noun phrases.<br>

            <br>
            In this project, we use library nltk to determine the structure of a sentence.<br>
            We provide the algorithm with rules for the grammar, the program can print the graphical representation of syntactic tree.<br>

            2.	Questions<br>
            Write an AI to answer questions.<br>
            <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/6/questions/" target="_blank" >https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/6/questions/</a><br>
            <br>
            We write a question answering system to perform document retrieval. <br>
            Weâ€™ll use tf-idf to rank documents based both on term frequency for words in the query and inverse document frequency for words in the query.
